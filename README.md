<h1 align="center">Human ribome Analysis - Storici & Jonoska Lab</h1>
This repository contains the code used to analyze ribonucleotide (RNA nucleotide) incorporation in human nuclear genomic DNA across multiple cell types. When ribonucleotides are embedded in DNA, they appear as ribonucleoside monophosphates (rNMPs).

This bioinformatics analysis is the result of a collaborative effort between researchers in Dr. Francesca Storici’s lab at Georgia Tech and mathematicians in Dr. Natasha Jonoska’s lab at the University of South Florida.

A full description of the study and results can be found in the following bioRxiv preprint:

<!-- Installation -->
## Installation
### Getting the code
Get development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/DKundnani/hu_nucl_ribome_analysis
```

### Required format of files
* Input files (bed) containing single nucleotide locations, mainly for rNMP data. [GSE297046, GSE333819] (another single nucleotide data can also be experimented on!)
* Reference genome files (.fa and .fai) of the organism being used(Also used to generate bed files) [hg38]
* Range files in preferably bed format. 

<!-- USAGE -->
## Breakdown of each folder as independent analysis
Please go into each repository to get usage and other details for each analysis.
* rNMP_EF: rNMP Enrichment Factor and Frequency calculation with rNMP EF heatmaps
* distribution_analysis: rNMP enrichment distribution around a fixed coordinate(s) in the genome
* rNMP randomized distrubtion and sequence association: Creating random rNMPs in the genome and histogram analysis, with getting mono and di-nucleotide correlations with rNMPs in discrete bins across the genome
* omics_processing: Standard pipelines used for RNA-seq, DNA-seq, bisulphite-seq and MACS2 peak calling in the study
* feature_correlations: Multi-omics associations for all rNMPs and different bases of rNMPs with expression and methylation data
* strand_bias: Study of strand bias near Transcription Start Site(s) and gene region
* agarose gel analysis: Distribution analysis of denatured DNA in presence and absence of RNase HII enzyme
* fragment size analysis: Simulation and estimation of rNMPs causing breaks in the agarose gel analysis
